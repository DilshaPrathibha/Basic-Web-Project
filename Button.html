            Rent, lease, or lend the software.
            Ownership

            The licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the software, 
            including all intellectual property rights. This agreement does not grant you 
            any ownership rights in the software.
            Termination

            This license is effective until terminated. Your rights under this license 
            will terminate automatically without notice from the licensor if you fail 
            to comply with any terms of this agreement. Upon termination, you must cease
             all use of the software and destroy all copies of the software.
            Updates

            The licensor may provide updates or modifications to the software. These

              fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
            Limitation of Liability

            In no event shall the licensor be liable for any special, incidental,
             indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever arising out of the use 
             of or inability to use the software, even if the licensor has been 
             advised of the possibility of such damages.

              law principles.
            Entire Agreement

            the licensor and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
            understandings regarding the subject matter hereof.
